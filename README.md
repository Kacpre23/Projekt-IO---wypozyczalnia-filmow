# Code Standards:

During the project development, we established the following coding standards:
- We used camelCase;
- We did not use abbreviations in function names;
- We used comments to explain functions and their operation, and we tried to avoid programming constructs that should not be used in C++, such as goto.

---
# Code Documentation:

- We documented code lines through commenting and communicated with each other through messaging to inform about changes in the code. We used code comments to explain why something was done.
- The documentation was made in Polish using the UML language.

---
# Code Refactoring (example function "search()"):
- It is located on the Search branch (history of the previous code version).
